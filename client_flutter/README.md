# Gamr Flutter Client

This directory contains a minimal Flutter application intended as a starting point for an iOS client for Gamr.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and set up the iOS toolchain.
2. Copy `lib/secrets.example.dart` to `lib/secrets.dart` and add your API keys.
3. Run `flutter run` to launch the application.

The current implementation only includes placeholder screens for Home, Search, Library and Profile.
